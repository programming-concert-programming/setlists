# Placeholder directory for UPV playlist

This directory could be used to host a local copy of `.txt` files for playlist (sic, not setlist) from the UPV project.
- The files are named after Spotify features in the form `<feature>.txt`.
- The features are:
    `acousticness`, `danceability`, `energy`, `instrumentalness`, `liveness`, 
    `loudness`, `popularity`, `speechiness`, and `tempo`.
- These values and the choice of playlists come from
  - Schweiger et al. (2021) Does track sequence in user-generated playlists matter?
